CraftIRC3 is currently in debugging/documenting phase prior to a wider release.
CraftIRC3 source is available on this repository under the branch "three" and can be easily built with the Maven POM.

CraftIRC2 which currently resides in the "master" branch will perhaps undergo a final maintenance release by Animosity, before becoming legacy.
I welcome anyone else to maintain or contribute to the CraftIRC2 branch and prolong its life and support of plugins that use CraftIRC2.


CraftIRC3 is incompatible with plugins which utilize CraftIRC2 (e.g. HeroChat) and those plugins must be updated to the new API.
The new API has documentation in this Github repo's Wiki, which will be ported to BukkitDev very soon.
