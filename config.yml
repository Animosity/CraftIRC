# Welcome, new user! Please read carefully:

# CraftIRC is a very powerful and flexible tool for all your communication needs. Being fully customizable, it TAKES SOME TIME TO SET UP.
# Please set aside half an hour to READ THIS FILE CAREFULLY and configure everything according to your needs. If you don't, CraftIRC
#   will NOT WORK PROPERLY.
# The CraftIRC developers can be found on #craftirc in irc.esper.net . Read the topic on arrival. If you have a specific issue you need
#   help with and we are around, we will help. BUT WE WILL NOT SET UP CRAFTIRC FOR YOU. If you don't want to/can't do this yourself, try
#   asking a friend or maybe if you're really lucky a user in #crafirc is feeling generous ;)

# Recommendations: http://instantyaml.appspot.com/ (the output doesn't matter, just see if there are errors) ; save as UTF-8 ; use a text
#   editor with YAML syntax highlighting to make the file more readable.

# ******************* MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS *******************
settings:

  #These tags identify built-in endpoints (for the paths: section). Other endpoints may be provided by plugins.
  minecraft-tag: 'minecraft'  #A basic game-side endpoint (a chat plugin may provide better functionality).
  cancelled-tag: 'cancelled'  #Cancelled chat is sent here (and nothing else).
  console-tag: 'console'      #The minecraft server console.
  
  #Set this to true to have CraftIRC cancel all minecraft chat if no other plugin is doing it.

  formatting:
    #### VARIABLES AND COLORS (from colormap): %name% (as in %message% or %yellow%). Different events provide different variables.
    #### IRC FORMATTING: %b% %u% %r% %o% %k% %kNUM% (NUM is 0 to 15); Do the same as CTRL+key in mIRC (%o% uses'foreground')

# ******************* COMMUNICATION PATHS ******************* [CHANGES REQUIRED]
# Declare here a path for every pair of endpoints between which you want messages to flow.
# For each path you can filter the messages sent by event type or contents.
# Paths are one-way, so you must declare A to B and B to A if you want a two-way channel.
paths:

  - source: 'minecraft'
    target: 'changeme'
    
  - source: 'changeme'     # These are endpoint tags
    target: 'minecraft'    #
    
    #Every path can contain a list of filters. Use for swearword censorship, blocking by user, etc.
    filters:
      #Each filter contains regular expressions for formatting variables. This one ignores commands (.TEXT)
      - message: '^\.[^ ]+'

    #Every path can override the formatting strings defined in settings.formatting .
    formatting:
    #  chat: '[%srcChannel%] <%sender%> %message%'
    #  join: '[%srcChannel%] * Joins: %sender%'
      
    #Every path can override the attributes block from default-attributes (see below).

    #A path can inherit missing attributes from another existing path rather than from default-attributes.
